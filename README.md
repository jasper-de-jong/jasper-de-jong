### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have worked for 12 years as a biomedical researcher and am now in the middle of switching to a career in data science. I am working on making the switch to bioinformatics and data communication.
Iâ€™m currently working on projects analyzing lipidomics and microbiome data which I am using as tools to learn new skills. I am currently expanding my knowledge of R, biostatistics and data visualization and communication tools. 
Reach out to me at jasper.jma@gmail.com.
